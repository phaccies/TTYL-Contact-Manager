# TTYL Contact Manager
TTYL is a contact manager that allows users to create an account, log in, and then manage contacts. They can create new contacts, edit existing ones, and delete. Users can also search through their contacts. This was a group project in which all members had different roles: Database, APIs, Project Manager, Frontend Development. We all worked together to create a refined, finished product.
